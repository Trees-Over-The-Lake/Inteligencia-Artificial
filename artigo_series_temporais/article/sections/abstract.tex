    Every year, the population of Brazil grows by a given factor, increasing demand 
    for a higher operating budget in cities, states and the country. The factor 
    that denotes said growth is given by a combination of different variables 
    such as access to sanitation, universal healthcare and better infrastructure, 
    which are the foundation for supporting a bigger population. Discovering this 
    growth factor can help a number of government institutions, planning departments 
    and cities in taking into account projected growth when reporting future operating 
    budgets to the federal government of Brazil. This study aims to develop a 
    machine learning model that is able to easily and reliably project said population 
    growth, especially in small towns that donâ€™t have enough data to train a multivariable model.
